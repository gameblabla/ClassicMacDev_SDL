These project files were built with CodeWarrior Pro 5.3 and Pro 6.0,
but should work with any CWPro 5.0 or later. CWPro 7.0+ will ask you
to convert the project when you first open it (might destroy File Mappings).

Setup: 

To build  the libraries or testers, simply put the CWprojects folder at the
root level of the SDL directory and build them.

Conventions Used:

"MacOS"  targets Classic MacOS /  (PowerPC)
"Carbon" targets OSX / CarbonLib  (PowerPC)
"Win32"  targets Windows (x86)

"Debug" targets:   static libraries, debugging info, no optimization
"Release" targets: shared libraries, no debugging info, max optimization

".LIB"  == static library
".DLL"  == shared library
".STUB" == stub library
".rsrc" == resources

Targets:

SDL MacOS Debug   - preferred for debugging SDL code via IDE Debugger
SDL MacOS Release - optional for shipping/distributing your application                   
SDLmain MacOS     - Classic and Carbon main replacement to read arguments/prefs

SDL MacOS Release StdCLib - preferred for shipping/distributing for Classic
                              - uses Standard C Library ("StdCLib") in System

SDLmain MacOS StdCLib - use in conjunction with above library.

* Note the following require the latest Carbon SDK and the folder "Carbon Support" 
  to be located alongside "MacOS Support" in root compiler folder.

SDL Carbon Debug    - use to debug new carbonized code
SDL Carbon Release  - requires carbonized MSL == CW 6.0+
                       - add "MSL C.Carbon.Lib", "MSL SIOUX.Carbon.Lib" to project
                         
SDLmain Carbon      - main method for Carbon SDL applications

SDL MacOS Resource - resources required by SDL applications
SDL Stub Library   - use to link to shared library
   
Win32 targets: same conventions.
The Win32 targets need to be updated. The Win32 SDK needs to be updated to get this to work also.

Testers:

Before building tests, on MacOS build SDL MacOS Debug, SDLmain MacOS, and SDL MacOS Resource first. On Win32, build SDL Win32/x86 Debug and SDLmain Win32/x86

Hints:
- If testbitmap does not build, change the "picture.xbm" file's TYPE code to "TEXT"
- In testgl.c, #define HAVE_OPENGL
- Check stdout.txt and stderr.txt if testers fail, hold <cmd> at startup to enter
  required arguments
