These project files were built with CodeWarrior Pro 5.3, but should work with
CWPro 5.0 or later. 

Requires:
You must link with SDL to use this library. 

Files:
sdl_mixer.mcp     - CodeWarrior 5 project file
sdl_mixer.mcp.exp - symbols that are exported in stub lib and dll
    If symbols are missing i.e. you have link problems:
    1. Remove the .exp file (trash it).
    2. Clean and rebuild shared lib.
    3. Open the new .exp file, edit it and save.
    4. Rebuild shared lib and stub lib.
   
sdl_mixer.prefix.h - compile options
sdl_mixer.shlib.r  - version resource and finder balloon info

Folders:
include - required SDL headers
lib     - stub link library for SDL
platform - contains any addition platform support we need (ITC some string funcs).
Output:
SDL Mixer.PPC.DLL  - optimized shared library. Put this in application directory or extensions folder (other locations possible). Requires  MSL C.PPC.DLL to be present in one of these locations.

SDL Mixer.PPC.LIB  - debug  static library. Link with this to debug SDL Mixer since you can't debug shared libraries in current CodeWarrior.

SDL Mixer.PPC.STUB - stub link library. Link with this if you are using the shared library.

Notes:
For the shared lib, the .exp file governs what symbols will be available to whomever links to the dll or stub lib.
Shared lib project uses G3 optimizations.

Not compiled:
MP3 playback is not available, would require port of SMPEG.
